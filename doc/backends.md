## Configuration of backends
Local and remote jobs are placed through the definition of one or more
backends that are defined in a configuration file located at `~/.sjef/molpro/backends.xml` and/or `/usr/local/etc/sjef/molpro/backends.xml`.
The following fields normally need to be specified in order to define the backend.

- `name` The name to be used as a handle for the backend
- `host` Hostname, possibly with user name, for ssh communication with the remote. If omitted, jobs are run on the local machine.

The following fields are optional.
- `run_command` The command used to run the job. This might simply be `molpro`, which is the default, or an explicit filesystem path to source a particular instance of molpro. The command can be appended with some options. At job submission time, the input file name is appended to `run_command`.
- `cache` Directory on the remote that will host the cache.
  The project is placed within that directory using the absolute path name on the local host, in order to avoid conflicts between projects. Note that the cache path does not contain the host name of the local host, since that can sometimes change, but as a consequence one should be aware of the potential of clashes between projects generated on different machines.
  If not specified, a sensible default for `cache` is chosen.

If jobs are to be run informally on the remote, this is all that is needed, provided that `molpro` is found in the path on the remote machine.  If jobs are instead to be launched using a batch system, the following additional fields need to be defined.
- `run_command` The command used to submit the job. This will normally be a script file that submits an appropriate batch job to launch molpro. At job submission time, the input file name is appended to `run_command`.
- `run_jobnumber` A [regular expression](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/regex/ECMAScript/) that extracts the job number from the output of `run_command`.
- `kill_command` A command that will kill the job, when the job number is appended.
- `status_command` A command that will query the status the job, when the job number is appended.
- `status_waiting` A [regular expression](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/regex/ECMAScript/) that matches the output of _status_command_ if the job is waiting to run.
- `status_running` A [regular expression](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/regex/ECMAScript/) that matches the output of _status_command_ if the job is running.

In `iMolpro`, an appropriate construction template for Slurm batch systems is provided.

Within the definition of `run_command`, a simple keyword substitution mechanism is available:

- `{prologue text%param!documentation}` is replaced by the value of parameter `param` if it is defined, prefixed by `prologue text`. Otherwise, the entire contents between `{}` is elided.
- `{prologue %param:default value!documentation}` works similarly, with substitution of `default value` instead of elision if `param` is not defined. `!documentation` is ignored in constructing the completed run command, but can be queried by programs using the library, so it is good practice to write a description that would help a user to understand if and how the parameter should be specified.


Example:
```xml
<backends>
  <!-- there is a default template backend always added to the configuration file by the library
    if it does not yet exist.  If not specified, it is  constructed automatically as
    <backend name="local" run_command="molpro"/>
  -->
  <backend name="local" host="localhost"
           run_command="molpro {-n %n!MPI size} {-M %M!Total memory} {-m %m!Memory per process} {-G %G!GA memory}"
  />
  <!-- local backend with special options -->
  <backend name="special_local" host="localhost" run_command="molpro {-n %n:2!MPI size} {-m %m:100M!Memory} {-G %G!GA memory}"/>
  <!-- informal immediate launching of Molpro on a neighbouring workstation -->
    <backend name="linux" host="user@host" cache="/tmp/sjef-backend" run_command="molpro"/>
    <backend name="linux2" host="linux2" cache="/tmp/peter/sjef-backend" run_command="myMolpro/bin/molpro"/>
  <!-- an example of a Slurm system, with qmolpro a wrapper that constructs a Molpro job script,
       and submits with srun -->
    <backend name="slurmcluster"
             host="{%user}@slurmcluster.somewhere.edu"
             cache="/scratch/{%user}/sjef-project"
             run_command="/software/molpro/release/bin/qmolpro {-t %t!time limit in seconds} {-n %n!number of MPI processes} {-m %m!memory} {-G %G!Global Arrays memory} {-q %q:compute!batch queue}"
             run_jobnumber="Submitted batch job *([0-9]+)"
             kill_command="scancel"
             status_command="squeue -j"
             status_running=" (CF|CG|R|ST|S) *[0-9]" status_waiting=" (PD|SE) *[0-9]"
    />
</backends>
```
